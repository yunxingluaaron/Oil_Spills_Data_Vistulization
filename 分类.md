All the numbering are lablelled in excel.

## 1. 分类的准则
Vessel: `fishing`: `120` <br>
        `dredge`: 122 <br>
        `tug`:123 <br>
        `boat`: 131 <br>
        
## 2. 值得挖掘的点

2.1 `line 130`: `Unknown Oil` A USCG helicopter overflight at 1700 hrs confirmed the presence of a small slick roughly 0.25 x 0.25 miles in size composed of silver sheen with spots of dark oil. <br>

## 3. 现在的思路 07.05.2023 <br>

1. 之前一直使用的是最原始：关键词分类，然后删选，但是问题是 1. 如果是单个关键词挑选，这样不准；2. 多个关键词标注的话，这样处理很麻烦；3.不涉及到machine leanring <br>
2. 所以现在的思路就是自己读取出来200个数据点做training, 然后利用 nlp 进行墨西哥湾和整个的世界的预测 <br>
3. Manually_create_training_label_Reading_Model_Training 截止到 `7月6号晚上12:30`，已经做好了200个人工的training data, 然后再这个文件里面training的准确率达到92% <br>
4. 可以进行下一步了：1. leak volume study; 2. 每一个分类细节的研究 3. embed到vue复杂的code里面. <br>

## 4. 特殊的分类标注 <br>

1. facility里面增加了 dredge <br>


## 5. 特殊的漏油量的标注 <br>

1.  carrying 1,700,000 barrels of Nigerian crude.
2.  It is estimated that between 9000-10000 barrels of light crude may have been spilled
3.  Approximately 5,500 barrels of #6 fuel oil from the Texaco Convent Refinery, reportedly cut with diesel oil
4.   At the time, the warehouse contained approximately 10,000 pounds of HTH, a commercial swimming pool chemical; 1,000 pounds of copper sulphate, 2,000 pounds of calcium hypochlorite; and 3,000 chlorinated cartridge filters.
5.   At 1400 local time, USCG contacted the SSC in regards to a 113 gallon spill of Louisiana crude oil reported earlier in the morning on 29 May 2008
6.   Vessel reported to be carrying 5,000 gallons of diesel
7.   The dredge had onboard at time of incident some 3000 to 4000 gallons
8.   An estimated 500bbl crude oil was lost from one of three tanks on the platform.
9.   On June 8, 2021, the US Navy called with a request to assist with hazard assessment and response recommendations for 2 liters of petroleum ether and 2 liters of ethyl ether stored in a hazmat storage locker to assist with disposal
10.   A 55 gal. drum containing approx. 15 gal. of Methanol was blown off a platform
11.   The total discharge amount was estimated to be between 5bbls and 10 bbls with 3-5 bbls outside of containment in the waterway and marsh.
12.   However, the product in the pipeline is 80% produced water and 20% crude oil (API=30), so the estimated total potential oil spill is approx. 133BBL (5600gal).


## 6. 没有找到漏油量的原因 <br>
1. The NOAA SSC was notified by MSO Port Arthur on the afternoon of 24 Feb., 2000 of a pipeline spill in a marsh near Sabine Pass.  The spill was reported to be 800 yards east of the pass in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.  The nearest town is Johnsons Bayou.  The initial report was a spill of 5 bbl and in-situ burning is being considered.  The spill is still being investigated.  NOAA was requested to provide technical assistance.  USCG district 8. <br>

The sheen is reported as 9mi long and 100 ft wide. It is unknown where in the sheen is in relation to the provided lat/long. There was no initial information related to sheen orientation, product released, source  or follow-up information beyond NRC report. During subsequent conversations, the source was determined to be a natural gas pipeline and sheen is produced from condensate. USCG is seeking trajectory to determine shoreline impacts."

The incident started on the 7th. They reported losing 27 containers in the Gulf of Mexico after encountering rough seas. Six were reported recovered, and the remaining lost containers are believed to have sunk. There were 196 containers remaining on board upon arrival. 31 of these on "hatch" number 5 were damaged with 12 containing hazardous materials. There were NO incompatibility problems. Coast Guard, state, local, and industry response personnel and hazmat teams immediately responded and established a safety zone with appropriate air monitoring.Response operations began immediately. Off-loading of the barge's 165 undamaged containers from hatches 1, 2, 4, and 6 was accomplished by 0600 10 Nov. Ops since then have concentrated on safely "peeling" apart the stack of damaged containers. The primary hazardous materials of concern are toluene diisocyanate (TDI), dichloromethane (M2), and vinyl acetate.  USCG district 8.

6. "At 1230 September 30, 2004 Shell was notified that there could be a leak in the area of MP Block 151.  An overflight conducted by representatives of Shell, USCG, and NOAA confirmed the spill.  Sheen was observed with a point of origin at L 29d 11.24N, 088d 51.61W and stretched  to the S/SW about 3.8nm down to 29d 07.53N, 088d 53.85W."

At 0920 helicopter reports indicated that the slick, which measured approximately eight miles long and 1-1/2 miles wide, was about 21 nautical miles south of Grand Isle.  Subsequent reports from a Conoco oil platform air dispatcher indicated that the slick was oriented along an east-west axis and that it contained patches of dark "pudding-like" oil and silver to rainbow sheen.  A Coast Guard overflight confirmed the sighting and reported that the slick was moving west and appeared to be breaking up.  A Coast Guard vessel passing through the area described the material as somewhat stringy.  USCG district 8.
