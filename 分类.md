All the numbering are lablelled in excel.

## 1. 分类的准则
Vessel: `fishing`: `120` <br>
        `dredge`: 122 <br>
        `tug`:123 <br>
        `boat`: 131 <br>
        
## 2. 值得挖掘的点

2.1 `line 130`: `Unknown Oil` A USCG helicopter overflight at 1700 hrs confirmed the presence of a small slick roughly 0.25 x 0.25 miles in size composed of silver sheen with spots of dark oil. <br>

## 3. 现在的思路 07.05.2023 <br>

1. 之前一直使用的是最原始：关键词分类，然后删选，但是问题是 1. 如果是单个关键词挑选，这样不准；2. 多个关键词标注的话，这样处理很麻烦；3.不涉及到machine leanring <br>
2. 所以现在的思路就是自己读取出来200个数据点做training, 然后利用 nlp 进行墨西哥湾和整个的世界的预测 <br>

## 4. 特殊的分类标注 <br>

1. facility里面增加了 dredge <br>


## 5. 特殊的漏油量的标注 <br>

1.  carrying 1,700,000 barrels of Nigerian crude.
2.  It is estimated that between 9000-10000 barrels of light crude may have been spilled
3.  Approximately 5,500 barrels of #6 fuel oil from the Texaco Convent Refinery, reportedly cut with diesel oil
4.   At the time, the warehouse contained approximately 10,000 pounds of HTH, a commercial swimming pool chemical; 1,000 pounds of copper sulphate, 2,000 pounds of calcium hypochlorite; and 3,000 chlorinated cartridge filters.
5.   At 1400 local time, USCG contacted the SSC in regards to a 113 gallon spill of Louisiana crude oil reported earlier in the morning on 29 May 2008
6.   Vessel reported to be carrying 5,000 gallons of diesel
7.   The dredge had onboard at time of incident some 3000 to 4000 gallons
8.   An estimated 500bbl crude oil was lost from one of three tanks on the platform.
9.   On June 8, 2021, the US Navy called with a request to assist with hazard assessment and response recommendations for 2 liters of petroleum ether and 2 liters of ethyl ether stored in a hazmat storage locker to assist with disposal
10.   A 55 gal. drum containing approx. 15 gal. of Methanol was blown off a platform
11.   The total discharge amount was estimated to be between 5bbls and 10 bbls with 3-5 bbls outside of containment in the waterway and marsh.

## 6. 没有找到漏油量的原因 <br>
1. The NOAA SSC was notified by MSO Port Arthur on the afternoon of 24 Feb., 2000 of a pipeline spill in a marsh near Sabine Pass.  The spill was reported to be 800 yards east of the pass in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.  The nearest town is Johnsons Bayou.  The initial report was a spill of 5 bbl and in-situ burning is being considered.  The spill is still being investigated.  NOAA was requested to provide technical assistance.  USCG district 8. <br>
32587	ARCO Platform B #1; South Pass, Mississippi River Delta, Louisiana	South Pass, Mississippi River Delta, Louisiana	Utah	UT	USA	29.1723	-88.8693	Oil		crude oil			At 1940 on March 19, 1989, ARCO Platform B exploded at its location five miles east of the mouth of South Pass on the  Mississippi River.  The ensuing fire spread to an adjacent quarters and support platform; seven persons were reported missing from the platform.  An oil slick measuring 100 yards wide by two miles long was visible.  USCG district 8.

2. "41766	Mystery Sheen; Mississippi Canyon Block 21, LA	Mississippi Canyon Block 21, LA	Mississippi	MS	USA	28.9185	-88.923	Oil	Mystery Substance	OIl	1764	unknown	On May 7, 2014, at At approximately 1:00 pm (CST) Sector NOLA contacted the NOAA SSC regarding an unknown sheen in Mississippi Cannyon Block 61. Coast Guard overflight at 1330 (CST) identified an overall impacted area approximately 20-30 miles long and 8 miles wide from Mississippi Canyon, Block 21 to Main Pass, Block 41 in the Gulf of Mexico. US Coast Guard requested a trajectory, and, if possible, some indication as to source, based on information from the overflght"

3. "40954	Condensate Sheen; South Marsh Block 236, LA	South Marsh Block 236, LA	Utah	UT	USA	29.33333333	-92	Oil	Pipeline	Condensate		pipeline	On 15FEB12 USCG Morgan City contacted NOAA SSC in regards to a mystery sheen reported at 0745 CST. The sheen is reported as 9mi long and 100 ft wide. It is unknown where in the sheen is in relation to the provided lat/long. There was no initial information related to sheen orientation, product released, source  or follow-up information beyond NRC report. During subsequent conversations, the source was determined to be a natural gas pipeline and sheen is produced from condensate. USCG is seeking trajectory to determine shoreline impacts."
